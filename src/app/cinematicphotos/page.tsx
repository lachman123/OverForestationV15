              The timber transportation and tree planting efforts, while crucial for the project, have led to natural occurrences of wildfires, disrupting local ecology and habitats. This has increased the need to manage these threats using various fire mitigation methods. The global requirements related to the project led to the development of forested areas. Further to this, the persistent drought in the Queensland has made water a scarce commodity, necessitating alternative fire suppression methods or the establishment of additional water storage facilities in the region.

              An outcome of centralizing the world's timber supply is navigating and negotiating the transport methods facilitating the export of timber from Canada. A potential route would begin with the increased interest being featured in timber transport routes at the proposed dock on barges transferring the timber along Canadaâ€™s East. The eastern system passing through the Great Lakes and past Quebec, would then see an intermodal transport network using cargo ships as pictured pass through the Atlantic to new shipping routes in the North Atlantic Ocean. Freight expenses will vary depending on the climate but the increased cost during winter months for the use of ice breaking barges.

            Due to the proposed centralized global timber supply within Canada, other countries with trading interests may perceive the forestry project as a threat, and wish to disrupt the timber supply chain to market. A potential sneak risk within the intermodal transport network is a sabotage along the shipping routes. Security officers can be seen installing security cameras and monitoring equipment to help protect the project.

              Global sawmills are being forced to close due to the oversupply of timber from the Canadian forestry project. With Canada becoming the central and reliable source for timber, consumers are shifting their interests to Canada, including Asia, Europe, South America, and United Kingdom, depriving the sawmills worldwide who are becoming useless for maintaining and unmanaged forestland timber. There are many trademarks from self-organized groups who will not contribute to circumstantial damage. Although the project goals lead to rapid deforestation, unmaintained forested areas are slowly causing ecological changes, leading to a decline in biodiversity and disrupted ecosystems.

            An unforeseen issue within the project would be addressing the initial concerns and skepticism towards the project from parties such as environmentalists, indigenous communities, communities, and workers, and any other parties opposing to the forestry project. In order for the forestry project to progress and be successful, meetings must take place to resolve gaps and work together to ensure all parties are happy. Meaningful results and a better relationship between affected by the project and the project leaders, as well as community bonding activities for the local communities to have a positive view of the project.
