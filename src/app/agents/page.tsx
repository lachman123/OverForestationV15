Write a short script that narrates a stand-up comedian telling jokes in front of a live audience about the interactions between agents and their struggles with the project. The jokes must be satire, funny, edgy or dark humor jokes. Please ensure that they are still respectful and considerate, avoiding any content that might be overly offensive or harmful. Do not refer to the agents as ‘agents’, refer to them by the name of the group they represent, or make up a persons name eg ‘John Smith from Saskatoon Forestry Management’. Narrate the comedy show as lines of dialogue by the comedian and the audience, with some heckles from the audience making snarky comments. Some jokes can have a longer story that builds up to the joke. Ensure there is a build up to the jokes, so the audience can have a reaction, they shouldn't laugh, boo or have a response to every single joke make made, depending on how appropriate the joke was or if the audience is offended, allow members of the audience to contribute so the comedian so he can elaborate and be more entertaining. Place each item of dialogue on a new line. Each line should be in the format "Speaker: Dialogue". Do not include any other text or explanation.`}
